# Project Development Workflow

This repository is divided into **frontend** and **backend** sections.  
We follow a **feature-branch workflow** for both sides of the project.

## ðŸ“‚ Branch Naming Conventions

```bash
# For Backend Feature
git checkout -b backend/<feature-name>

# For Frontend Feature
git checkout -b frontend/<feature-name>
